# DIY-Arduino-Gaming-Controller
DIY Arduino Gaming Controller is a custom device using an ADXL345 accelerometer and joystick to simulate keyboard and mouse inputs. An Arduino Uno reads motion and button data, sending it via serial to a Python script, which maps it to actions like movement, firing, jumping, and reloading using pyserial and pyautogui.
